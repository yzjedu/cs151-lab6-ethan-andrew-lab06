In this lab my partner and I were supposed to get practice with refactoring functions, testing code, error checking, and utilizing the many other aspects of Python we've learned so far.

Using what the class has learned from previous lectures, our group followed the design process/steps in first understanding the readme in its full, developing an algorithm, peer reviewing those, test cases, and then developing our code. We used each other as peer reviewers as a technique to solve any difficulties we had or errors. Key concepts explored were using while loops, Booleans, as well as error checking.

Our group’s results did match what we expected. Because we heavily designed our program through our algorithm, it was easier to do our code and get the results we expected. Our group also developed multiple test cases, which helped us make sure our code worked well.

The challenges we encountered were developing our algorithm and communication. Ethan was not here during the previous lab which had an impact on this lab, so it was difficult at first to know where to start and work without a partner but it ended up working well and we exchanged phone numbers and completed our lab the way we wanted to. Our group had also not previously developed an algorithm so complex, so it was difficult at first, but with professor’s help and feedback I believe it ended well. I think my key takeaways from this lab was the refactoring process, incorporating while loops and error checking, and how they can help take your code to the next level and help out a lot. I do believe our group ended up learning what we were supposed to from this lab. It was nice working with a partner that way we could split the workload and give each other ideas.
